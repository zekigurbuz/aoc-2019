# __Advent of Code 2019 (Java) Solutions__
## This is a compilation of my solutions to the 2019 Advent of Code competitive programming competition.
### The programs are split up into days just as they are on the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/2019).
### Please leave a star if these are helpful to you or if you learned anything new from my code!
>Note: Although all of my files are named either **part1.java** or **part2.java**, the actual code will work only in a file named as **Solution.java**. This is to make it easier for you to distinguish what file accomplishes what task.
